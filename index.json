Learn more at our Devpost page\nInspiration #\rOver the course of hundreds years, floods have been worsening since its first strike in Indonesia. Mainly because the ground’s ability to contain water is reduced to an irreversible level. Although several methods had been applied in order to restore the absorbability back to normal, countless urban areas which include large buildings are currently unreachable to reforestations. And therefore, rerouting of excess water is crucial in order to prevent floods from happening.\nWe must prevent this devastating disaster from happening in the future by creating ways for society to adapt to geological situations around the country. However, there are no significant results from these somewhat traditional methods.\nWhat it does #\rThis water level detector will work in 3-steps, automatically sending and after receiving the reflected waves, the tool will immediately send the sound to the mainboard and warn local residents via a module installed onboard and opens up a valve for the upper water bank to route excess water into the lower bank.\nThe automation is made possible with the help of our ever lovely Telegram bot, Doodadeed. Fear not, we use big capacity batteries that can last up to a year, and the requirement of manual checking is none.\nHow we built it #\rWe programmed a NodeMCU ESP-12E as the mainboard connected to an ultrasonic sensor. We also hooked up a few necessary components such as a voltage regulator, a servo, and some resistors. The design is simple enough for anyone to learn. And the components aren’t so pricey either. Because we wanted AFEWS-E to be easily build by anyone across the globe!\nFuture Planning #\rThe tool will use Artificial Intelligence Design technology that is more ergonomic Use of a more appropriate chip to detect greater areas Waterproof design Solar panel utilization\n","date":"3 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"dimcoord.github.io/posts/automatic-flood-early-warning-system-and-eco-drainage-afews-e/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Automatic Flood Early Warning System and Eco-drainage (AFEWS-E)","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"3 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"dimcoord.github.io/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"3 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"dimcoord.github.io/","section":"dimcord","summary":"","title":"dimcord","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"3 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"dimcoord.github.io/categories/internet-of-things/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Internet of Things","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"3 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"dimcoord.github.io/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"3 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"dimcoord.github.io/categories/tech/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Tech","type":"categories"},{"content":"As you may have noticed, this website is built on top of Hugo framework. Hugo is a Go-based, open-source static site generator. It can be used to create websites, blogs, and various other kinds of web content by producing HTML pages from markdown source content. Hugo is a popular choice for creating static websites since it is quick, adaptable, and simple to use.\nSo why use Hugo if there are other kinds of No-Code website generator on the internet? Well, Hugo is famous for having an extensive set of editable themes, quick build speeds, and simplicity of usage. With Hugo, you can easily develop and build a fully complete website without the need for complicated back-end infrastructure. I think Hugo is a simple and effective way to create a static website, regardless of your level of development expertise.\nGet started with Hugo #\rTo start things up, you just need some basic knowledge in using terminal on your computer. And if you know a thing or two about Git and text markdown, it might as well help you big time. And regardless of your device, Hugo can be installed in almost all operating systems. Windows, Linux, and even Android can run Hugo.\n","date":"2 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"dimcoord.github.io/posts/create-a-free-blog-in-30-minutes/","section":"Posts","summary":"Let\u0026rsquo;s learn how to create your own website for free!","title":"Create A Free Blog In 30 minutes!","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"dimcoord.github.io/categories/no-code/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"No-Code","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"2 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"dimcoord.github.io/categories/web-development/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Web Development","type":"categories"},{"content":"Hello world and happy new year, folks!\n","date":"1 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"dimcoord.github.io/posts/my-first-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"My First Post","type":"posts"},{"content":"\rPersonal Information #\rFull Name: Dimastio Setiawan\nCurrent Address: Bandung, Indonesia\nBackground: Programming, design, animation\nSummary #\rHello, I\u0026rsquo;m Dimas, the author.
